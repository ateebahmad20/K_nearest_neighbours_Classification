The nearest neighbor algorithm is most suitable for classification tasks. 
In nearest neighbor approach to learning, the whole training dataset is used for the purposes of prediction for a new data point. 
For each new data point, its distance from all the data points in the training set is calculated. 
The prediction is then the label of the data point in the training examples that is closest to the new data point. 
In the k-nearest neighbor approach, we find k training examples that are closest to the new data point. 
The most common label/output of those k training examples is the prediction for the new data point. 

A Data set of plants were taken and classification was done on them using the KNN classification technique.
